# Checklisting

## Mostly a way for me to learn React
### But also I want to have a simple, editable, shareable checklist app.

Created with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Not ejected yet!

Clone this then `yarn install` (or `npm install`? not sure which. I think it's `yarn`, that's what the docs say.)

Make edits, then `npm run build` to get a `build` folder to deploy however you like.
